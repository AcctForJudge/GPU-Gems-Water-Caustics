## Water Caustics ##

Creating caustics in real time from a predetermined function that generates waves. I somewhat understand the maths and technique behind this, but i am highly inexperienced in graphics programming.
Soooo, i took a lot of help from [here](https://github.com/ColtonASimmons/GPU-Gems-Water-Caustics/)
